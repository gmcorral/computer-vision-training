Below is a snippet for loading and and taking a look at the dataset via S3 below. It's highly recommended to use the below method to avoid a needless local import. \n\n* Here's some documentation from the Eider team in case you want to import from local on a separate project: [UserFileUpload](https://w.amazon.com/index.php/Eider/Documentation/UserFileUpload)" ]
